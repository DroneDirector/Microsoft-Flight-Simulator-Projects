# Replaceable models

Put a `.glb` file (glTF binary) with one of these names in this folder, in the sub-folder shown, and build the app.
The app then uses it instead of its own model everywhere that model appears: the 3D view, the pictures, the
water salute, the museum. Remove the file and the app's own model comes back. This list is written by the build.

**How the files should be made**

- glTF 2.0 binary (`.glb`), textures inside the file. Metres. **+Y up, the front (the nose) towards +Z** (glTF's own convention).
- The app fits each model to the real size of the thing it replaces (length), sets it on the ground and centres it across, so small differences in scale or origin do not matter.
- Aircraft: the app's own model still moves its gear, flaps and lights; a file's model is shown as it is (its own paint).
- Licences of bought models must allow commercial sale (see CLAUDE.md).

the aircraft, the people and the equipment stay the app's own). Metres, the doors towards +Z, the floor at 0, centred.
It is fitted to the size shown. Meshes named `window`, `glass` or `skylight` show the sky at the base (day, sunrise,
sunset, night). For the PC only, a file with `-pc` at the end (e.g. `hangars/hangar-large-pc.glb`) is used first, so
a heavier, higher-quality building can go to the PC while phones keep the lighter one.

| Name | What it is | How the app uses it |
|---|---|---|
| `slot-A1` … `slot-C3` | An empty node where each product stands, at the front of its shelf | The products (the app's, or their own files below) are set there, more of the same behind it |

Which product is in which slot: A1 cola, A2 lemon soda, A3 orange soda, B1 chocolate bar, B2 peanut bar, B3 sparkling water,
C1 oat bar, C2 iced tea, C3 caramel bar. Names may also use capitals or an underscore (`Slot_A1`).

## People (`people/`)

A base model for each gender and group of looks. The app picks the group from each person's look (skin tone and eyes);
when that file is missing it uses `person-male.glb` or `person-female.glb`, and when that is missing too its own figure.
Rig them with a skeleton; a bone named `Jaw` (or containing "jaw") opens the mouth while the person talks, and
animations named `Idle` and `Walk` are played when they stand and walk. Height is fitted to the person's own.
