// Security: your airline's own security officers (airport police work for the state; an airline hires its own
// security staff). They check passengers at the gate, guard the aircraft parked overnight, and deal with drunk or
// unruly passengers. Hired like ground staff (Crew → Security), paid weekly at an aviation security officer's going
// rate (about $40,000 to $48,000 a year in the US, £25,000 in the UK, €37,000 in Germany), trained in the Training room.
// How good they are at an airport (how many, and their rating) decides:
//  - Gate checks: a very drunk passenger is spotted at the gate; you can send Security to collect them from the lounge,
//    where you see an officer walk over and lead them out (a weak officer may cause a scene the other guests notice).
//  - On board: a drunk passenger you let fly is less likely to make trouble when Security has briefed the crew.
//  - Aircraft parked overnight: guarded, or now and then a security incident (a breached fence, a stolen item).
//  - Reports now and then: what they checked and found, and sometimes a staff member's conduct (a conduct report).
// Everything here is behind one switch (secOn: Settings → Staff → Security), so the feature can be paused at any time
// without losing anyone hired or anything recorded.
