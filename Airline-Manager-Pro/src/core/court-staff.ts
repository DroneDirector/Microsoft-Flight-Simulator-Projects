// Taking a member of staff to court. When a conduct report is about something that endangered an aircraft or
// people, or broke the law (a skipped safety check, an aircraft hit with a vehicle, maintenance signed off
// without the paperwork, checklist shortcuts, reckless driving on the apron…), or the person was part of an
// accident, you can report it to the police: from your office (after talking to them, or straight from the list
// of reports) or from the report itself. The prosecutor charges them and you take part in the trial in the
// courtroom (court3d.ts):
//  - Day one: you are the prosecution's witness. The report and the person's record are shown as exhibits;
//    the prosecutor, the defence and the judge question you. Telling it as it is helps the case; exaggerating
//    can be found out, and it costs the case and your company rating.
//  - Day two: the defendant takes the stand and you put your own questions (open, confronting them with the
//    evidence, or pressing hard); how they answer depends on the kind of person they are (honest, defensive,
//    dismissive or lying, the same as in your office). A colleague is heard, both sides close, and you make
//    your statement as the injured party: leniency, a fair hearing or the full penalty, and damages.
//  - Lies have a way of coming out. Every answer you gave that wasn't true (an exaggeration, a denial the records
//    contradict) may leak after the verdict, even if the court believed you: the papers have it, your company
//    rating falls, a wrongful conviction is overturned and the employee compensated, and you are charged with
//    perjury and stand trial yourself (the defendant's chair, your own lawyer, the same courtroom).
//  - Then the verdict and the sentence, read out in court. They are suspended while the case runs. Found guilty,
//    prison or a lost licence ends the job, otherwise you decide; acquitted, they come back to work.
