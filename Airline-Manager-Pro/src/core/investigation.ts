// Accident investigations. When one of your aircraft crashes (a flight you flew and registered, or one flown by your
// hired crew), the country's accident investigation board opens an investigation:
//  - The preliminary report comes after one, two or three days, or within minutes (Settings → Staff → Court). Until
//    you have opened it, it stays in the notification bell and you are reminded of it again and again.
//  - Nothing in it is chance. The investigators follow the chain of events back from the crash: the aircraft's
//    condition and its unrepaired defects, the mechanics who looked after it (how many for the fleet, how qualified,
//    how they are paid, how they feel at work, quarrels between them), the pilot (their record, warnings, mood, and
//    how the aircraft was flown), and the airline above them (staffing, pay, warnings you were given). The cause is
//    either the aircraft or the pilot; working conditions are found behind either when they played a part.
//  - Eyewitnesses: near an airport someone always saw it (the tower, ground crew, people in the terminal); far from
//    one, maybe a farmer or a fisherman, maybe no one. Survivors are heard when there are any.
//  - You sign the report, or disagree and take it to court. When the airline, a mechanic or a pilot is found at fault
//    (or you disagree), the authority takes the case to court. You, the accountable manager, are always called; the
//    mechanic or pilot at fault is there too. Day one: the witnesses and the investigator are heard and you answer
//    the judge and the prosecutor. Only then comes the preliminary hearing, where the court decides whether there is
//    a case to answer. Then the trial: the person at fault on the stand, more questions, the plea and your last word,
//    and the verdict. The more serious the accident, the more you are asked, and the harder; if people died, it is
//    relentless. Every answer is checked against the records and moves your company rating, and the verdict follows.
//  - You are reminded in the bell until you go to court: the case waits for you.
