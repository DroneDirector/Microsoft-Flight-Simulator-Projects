// Replaceable models. Every aircraft type, ground vehicle, the jet bridge and the people have a file name in
// www/models/ (see www/models/README.md). When a .glb file with that name is there, the app uses it instead of
// its own built model, everywhere that model appears; when it isn't, the app's own model is used as before.
//  - The build lists the files that are there (www/models/index.json), so nothing is looked for that is missing.
//  - Files are loaded once and kept; each use gets its own copy.
//  - A model is fitted to the app's own one: turned so its nose (or front) points the right way, scaled to the
//    real length, and set on the ground. glTF's own axes: +Y up, the front towards +Z, metres.
